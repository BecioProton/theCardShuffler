## This repository contains 4 different "Human" method of card shuffling.

### My aim for this repository is to together with arrays and to see if a more human approach to this problem gives better results.

### As far as I am aware there are 4 ways to shuffle the card:

* Italian, a variation where the deck is usually shuffled in a more fluid, riffle-style fashion.
* OverHand, the classic and most well know, which you might have learned from your grandparents.
* Riffle, the classic card shuffle you might see in movies done the the casino croupier
* Hindu, a variant of the OverHand similar to how a Yu-GI-HO deck is shuffled.
* Faro, very similar to Riffle, just nicer to look at. 



### Also, if you want to use any of this code for your card game, please help yourself...


notes to self:

* how do you evaluate the effectiveness of a shuffling method?
    * Shannon entropy
    * Distribution measure or Montecarlo test(chi-square)
    * Correlation Between Successive Cards
